learned about react routers - used for routing to diffrent api's

we made a routing for our restaurant's were when someone clicks on the restaurant's card then it shows the data of the card

import { createBrowserRouter, RouterProvider, Outlet } from "react-router-dom";

createBrowserRouter contains alll the routes - also includes children of the main route
const appRouter = createBrowserRouter([
    {
        path: "/",
        element: <AppLayout />,
        children: [
            {;
                path: "/",
                element: <Body />
            },
            {
                path: "/about",
                element: <About />
            },
            {
                path: "/contact",
                element: <Contact />
            },
            // dynamic path - ":" - as here restaurant id will change for each restaurant.
            {
                path: "/restaurants/:resid",
                element: <RestaurantMenu/>
            }
        ],
        errorElement: <Error />
    },
]);

Outlet 
const AppLayout = ()=>{
    return (
        <div className="app">
            <Header />
            {/* according to routes - the childrens will come at the place of Outlet component */}
            <Outlet />
        </div>  
    );
};


RouterProvider - 
root.render(<RouterProvider router={appRouter} />);


import { Link } from "react-router-dom";
<li><Link to="/">Home</Link></li>
<li><Link to="/about">About Us</Link></li>
d


import { useRouteError } from "react-router-dom";
const Error = () => {
    const err = useRouteError();
    console.log(err);
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Oops!!!</h1>
            <h2>Something went wrong</h2>
            <h3>{err.status}: {err.statusText}</h3>
        </div>
    );
}
export default Error;
