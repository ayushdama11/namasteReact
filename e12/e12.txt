redux is not mandatory when using react
used for managaing state

zustand is same like redux

redux offers easy debugging 

redux dev tools - chrome extension

rtk - redux toolkit

// **** to write the data using redux
when we click on the add button, it :-
1. dispatches an action
2. then it calls the function - [reducer function] - and this function modifies the cart - basically will update the slice
 - we can't directly modify the cart


// **** to get the data using redux
- basically when i click on the add food item 
- than it shoudl change the number of food items in the cart in the header  :-  basically to get the data from the cart

so we use "selector" to read from our redux store containing slices and brings back that info to the header compoenent
this phenomena is known as subscribing to the store



import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

const cartSlice = createSlice({     // creating slices
    name: 'cart',
    initialState: {     // initial value
        items: []   // right now cart is empty
    },
    reducers: {
        // addItem is a dispatch function , and that in its right is the reducer function that modifies the slice of the store
        addItem: (state, action) => {
            state.items.push(action.payload);
        },
        removeItem: (state) => {
            state.items.pop();  // removing one item from the end
        },
        clearCart: (state) => {
            state.items.length = 0;     // to clear the cart
        },
    },
});

export const {addItem, removeItem, clearCart} = cartSlice.actions;

export default cartSlice.reducer;
